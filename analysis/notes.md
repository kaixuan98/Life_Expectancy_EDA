# Life Expectancy 
Living Longer is one of the goal of human kind. Ancient time where emperes or kings that are looking into the secret to live a longer life. Today with the help of data, we are able to see the factors that effecting our life expectancy. I will be using a dataset from Kaggle to do the analysis. The usability of the data is not that high, some of the data got from the World Bank. 
 
### What is life expectancy?
Based on OurWorldinData.org, life expectancy is the number of years a person can expect to live. 

### What factors extended life expectancy?
Based on the data, I splited into 3 main factors
1. Immunization Factors 
2. Soical Factors 
3. Economic Factors


### Why is it important to extend life expectancy? 

### Healthy Life Expectancy?
Not just live longer, we need to live healthier too. Where living healthier is not a main focus of this project, but I would like to bring out this point to make sure anyone that is reading it focus too much on living longer. 


### Life Expectancy Predictor (Web App) 
Idea: Put in the numbers and predict how long you will live 
- this will based on your social factors 
- the country that you are live in or born in 


### Conclusion 
Not just increase the life expectancy but increase the health of life expectancy. We want people that live longer and healthy.
